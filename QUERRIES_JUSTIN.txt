limit 10

B)Compute the average rating of the top- 100 rated clips per de cade in decreasing order

select avg(R.rank)
from ratings R NATURAL JOIN (select clipId, (floor(ClipYear/10) *10) as decade
				from clips) t
group by (decade)
ORDER BY R.rank desc LIMIT 100


C) For any video game director, print the first year he/she directed a game, his/her name and all his/her game titles from that year

and s.staffid = d.staffid 
and C.clipYear in (select MIN(Cl.clipYear)

D) For each year, print the title, year and rank-in-year of top 3 clips, based on their ranking
	
	select c.clipTitle, R.rank, c.clipYear
